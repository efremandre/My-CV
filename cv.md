### About My

Only at the age of 30 I realized what I wanted to do - to do frontend development. At the moment it is my hobby, the goal is to make it my profession. 

I have no commercial experience, only small training projects. But I make up for this with extensive experience in various industries and areas, a responsible approach to work, a clear understanding of what a deadline and "have to" are, the ability to work in a team, a black belt in soft-skills, and a huge potential for learning new things.

		return result;
	} else {
		matrix.forEach((elem, index) => {
			(index % 2 === 0) ? newArr.push(elem) : newArr.push(elem.reverse());
		});
	}

	return result.concat(...newArr);
